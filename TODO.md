## Testing & Validation

### Usability Testing

- [ ] Create test scenarios
- [ ] Recruit 5-10 test users
- [ ] Conduct usability sessions
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Document findings

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Test on different devices
- [ ] Measure load times
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Test network resilience
- [ ] Document performance metrics

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Check screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Verify color contrast
- [ ] Test with reduced motion
- [ ] Document accessibility features

## Next Steps After MVP

1. Analyze user feedback from testing sessions
2. Prioritize features based on user engagement
3. Plan next development phase
4. Update documentation
5. Prepare for beta release

## Notes

- Each task should include unit tests
- Document API usage and limits
- Consider rate limiting and caching
- Monitor performance metrics
- Keep security in mind
